# Using Native Javascript

The main target of building applications using native Javascript is to implement different approaches: functional and object-oriented.

Why different approaches? Because, so that newbies can learn how to make a tool using native Javascript and professionals can teach us (by their contribution) how to develop a Javascript Application the way it should be. So you are most welcome if you want to contribute or have a mind to be part of it.
