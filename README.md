# Using Native Javascript

The main target is building applications using native Javascript with different approaches: functional and object-oriented.

Making small applications using native Javascript so that newbies can learn how to make a tool using native Javascript and professionals can teach us (by their contribution) how to develop a Javascript Application the way it should be. So you are most welcome if you want to contribute or have a mind to be part of it.
